# Welcome to the ai16z Community

ai16z is an innovative project that combines the power of artificial intelligence with the principles of decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs) to revolutionize venture capital and foster an open-source community around AI agents.

## Our Mission

Our mission is to leverage the collective intelligence of our community and cutting-edge AI technologies to make informed investment decisions, support groundbreaking projects, and drive the evolution of AI agents.

## The Eliza Framework

At the core of ai16z lies the Eliza framework, an open-source toolkit that empowers developers to create and deploy AI agents capable of interacting on various platforms, such as Twitter and Discord. By providing a robust and flexible framework, we aim to accelerate the development and adoption of AI agents across different domains.

## Community-Driven Governance

ai16z operates as a DAO, enabling token holders to actively participate in the decision-making process and shape the future of the project. Through our unique governance model and the "Virtual Marketplace of Trust," community members can pitch ideas, provide insights, and influence investment strategies based on their expertise and track record.
