# @elizaos/plugin-primus

A plugin to fully verify agent activities, including LLM access, actions, and interactions with external providers, powered by Primus' zkTLS protocol.

## Overview

Here's a refined version of your text:

In the Eliza framework, an agent consists of three key components: a brain (accessing an LLM), actions (the tasks the agent performs), and perception (gathering external information from providers). To fully verify agent activities, it's essential to ensure that the agent's thoughts, actions, and external information requests are all verifiable. This plugin enables full verification of these activities.

The current plugin includes:

Verification of inference from OpenAI's LLM.
An example for verifying actions, such as posting a tweet (this can be extended to any other actions).
An example to verify that the Bitcoin price is accurately fetched from Binance (this can be extended to any other data providers).
